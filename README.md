# PPS-17-ese
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/KaikiKM/PPS-17-ese.svg?token=oWAmD57ERLq49pfkA9og&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/KaikiKM/PPS-17-ese)

An operating guide for using the system can be found in [this document](GuidaUtente.md)

## Requisiti

The project consists of an evolutionary simulation engine, with the following characteristics:

* Upon opening the user will be able to create different species with different physical characteristics and a set of possible genes that will modify the characteristics of the different individuals.

* Once the parameters are set, the system will simulate a two-dimensional environment in which the animals will move growing, reproducing and feeding on other animals or plants.

* In addition to displaying the world, the simulator will display information about the individual entities and aggregate statistics through graphs updated in real time.

* The system will realistically model the reproduction mechanism with the concept of dominant and recessive genes and the possibility that some of them present themselves within the population as a genetic mutation.

* A markup language will be used with which the simulation parameters can be defined or exported from a simulation configured via a graphical interface.
